# Promptu

Promptu is designed for you and your close friends to share fun photos with each other every day based on our “Prompt of the Day.” Get creative with the prompts and captions, and feel free to resubmit photos! At the end of the day, you and your friends get to vote on your favorite submissions, and the winner gets to choose the prompt for the next day. There are 4 default options and one “choose your own” option.

The project is deployed and hosted on Expo Go. To try out the app, follow the instructions on [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CMi-0NINyMdUpp79TLbahZKiBeswgU52hi7dmxAYEXc/edit?usp=sharing).
